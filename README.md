--Auto Decrescendo Adder--
by austinm34

This program depends on Lokasenna's GUI library:
https://github.com/jalovatt/Lokasenna_GUI

This script can be used to add decrescendos to midi parts using
the track volume envelope. It will automatically add a decrescendo
under any midi note longer than a specified length. It works best 
with melodies that only have a single note playing at a time.

If you would like to try it, make sure you install Lokasenna's
GUI library above and then you can just download this script
and paste it wherever you keep your ReaScripts :)
